<b>QFNS</b> is a package design of nameix <b>prosistor</b> — <b>S<i>μ</i></b> with the weight 1.49KHz i.e., a QFN (Quad Flat No Leads) with SMHS (Surface Mounted Heat Sink) to be a wotld first invention of MPRT (<i>μ</i><sup>®</sup>) architectured semiconductor. A prosistor is an invention &amp; design of two companies Sequømics, Inc. and Apple, Inc. — a genius CEO Prabhat Kumar and his co-scientist at California, USA, respectively.

A surface mounted heat sink, is an area to transfer the heat under steady-state conditions to be a great prosistor. The <b><i>r</i></b> of SMHS can be calculated by the formula and imposed on the QFN to design the semiconductor package QFNS. Thus, QFNS fabricated with the body size of 4.0mm<sup>2</sup>, have length of 4.0mm and width of 4.0 mm. The height of package is 2.0mm.

<b>Mathematics of QFNS:</b>

<b>1. Area & Diagonal of the Square:</b>

If a = 4.0mm, then

A = a<sup>2</sup> = 4×4 = 16

d = √2•a = √2•4 ≈ 5.65685

<b>2. Area & Circumference of the Circle:</b>

If r = 1.6mm; where π = 3.14159, then

A = π•r<sup>2</sup> = π•1.62<sup>2</sup> ≈ 8.04248

C = 2•π•r = 2•π•1.6 ≈ 10.0531

SMHS (Surface Mounted Heat Sink)

Through Hole Diameter Design

The through hole diameter is designed based on the pin location range for the THD. Through holes on printed wiring
boards are circular in shape and furthermore, since the pin thickness has a tolerance, the through hole diameter must be
designed to be larger by that amount.
This relationship is shown in figure 2.14, and the radius of the holes in the printed wiring board that takes the pin
thickness into account can be calculated as shown below.
r = (x / 2 + bMAX./ 2)2 + (cMAX./ 2)2
  = (0.25/ 2 + 0.60 / 2)2 + (0.35/ 2)2
  = 0.46 (mm)
Therefore, the diameter of through holes in the printed wiring board is given by Φ = 2 × r = 2 × 0.46 = 0.92 mm.
